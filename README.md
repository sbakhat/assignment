# Python Assignment

Submitted by:
- **Name:** Bakhat Shahi
- **Faculty:** BCSIT
- **Semester:** 2nd
- **Section:** A 

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates my understanding of Python programming fundamentals through practical implementation. It includes two sets of programs:
- Set A focuses on basic programming concepts like calculations, loops, patterns, and functions
- Set B implements advanced problem-solving techniques using algorithms and data structures

All programs are interactive and include proper error handling and user input validation.

## How to Run
1. Open `Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run each cell in order
3. Enter input when asked

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure

```
.
├── Assignment.ipynb    # Main Jupyter notebook containing all exercises
├── factorialmodule.py # Custom module for factorial calculation
└── README.md          # This documentation file
```

## Custom Modules

### factorialmodule.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
- Custom module for factorial calculation
- Used in exercise 8 of Set A

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Open `Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run cells sequentially to see the output
4. Input values when prompted
